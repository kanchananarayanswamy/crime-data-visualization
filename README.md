# 🚨 Crime Data Visualization

## 📌 Overview
This project provides tools to analyze and visualize crime datasets to identify **patterns, trends, and hotspots**. By transforming raw data into meaningful insights, it supports research, public awareness, and data-driven decision-making for law enforcement and policymakers.  

## ✨ Features
- 📊 Data preprocessing and cleaning of crime datasets  
- 📈 Interactive visualizations (charts, graphs, heatmaps)  
- 🔎 Trend analysis across time and categories  
- 🌍 Geospatial insights for crime hotspots  
- 📑 Exportable analytical reports  

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset contains crime records with attributes such as crime type, location, time, and frequency.  
- **Source**: *(Add your dataset source here, e.g., Kaggle, government open data, or custom dataset)*
